# Data_Analysis_Project1
My first small data analysis project using python

This project performs a basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a weather dataset.

The script utilizes the pandas library to:

Load the CSV data into a DataFrame
Get basic information about the data (dimensions, data types, etc.)
Find the unique values in specific columns
Count the occurrences of unique values in a column
Find the number of missing values
Rename columns
Calculate descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, variance)
Filter data based on specific conditions
Group data by a specific column and perform operations on each group
The script answers the following questions about the weather data:

Q1) Find all the unique wind speed values
Q2) Find the number of times the weather is exactly clear
Q3) Find the number of times the wind speed was exactly 4km/h
Q4) Find out all the Null Values in the data
Q5) Rename the column 'Weather' to 'Weather Condition'
Q6) What is the mean visibility?
Q7) What is the standard deviation of pressure?
Q8) What is the variance of relative humidity?
Q9) Find all instances when snow was recorded
Q10) Find instances when wind speed is above 24 and visibility is 25
Q11) Calculate the mean value of each numeric column for each weather condition
Q12) Find the minimum and maximum value of each column for each weather condition
Q13) Show all records where the weather condition is fog
Q14) Find instances when the weather is clear or visibility is above 40

This is a beginner-friendly project showcasing basic techniques for data exploration and analysis using pandas.

Prerequisites:

pandas library
Instructions:

Clone this repository.
Install the pandas library using pip install pandas.
Ensure you have the weather data file (file.csv) in the same directory as the script.
Run the script.
The output will be displayed in the console.
